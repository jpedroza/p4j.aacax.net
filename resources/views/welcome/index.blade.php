			<h1 id="title">Phase 1: Complete - Building a Functional Laravel Video Book Library</h1>
			<p id="middle">
				This project focussed on Leveraging the Laravel Framework to store, organize, and play a collection of videos along with some type of logon/logout system. 
				From all this fun, the hardest part was letting Laravel handle the SQL and core features. The next hardest part was figuring out the details of working with the video. Despite all the challenges, Laravel just seems too work if you let it. 
				Along with discovering the simplicity of HTML5, I found many ways how not to put Laravel together. Most importantly, I now can clearly see how Laravel brings organization and a clear approach of building the most common features professional websites require. 
				Even though it was a learning curve to climb, I already have a project at work to streamline and better organize routine operations. 
				Starting out, I tried too hard to make everything instead of using Laravel, until it clearly became apparent, that I was slowing myself down, reinventing the wheel, that Laravel was made for.

				Thank You. With all your help, videos, foobooks, notes, classmates, guidance, and lots of Mountain Dew, I was able to get the core parts working, which included a framework to hold, organize, and play mp4 videos, and now I am ready to start producing videos. <a href='/register'>click here to Register for an Content Reviewer/Author Account</a> or <a href='/'> click here to login.</a>
